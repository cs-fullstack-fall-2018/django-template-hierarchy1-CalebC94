# django-template-hierarchy1

THIS IS A SOLO CLASSWORK

Start from scratch. Create a new movie application with name, yearReleased, ageAllowed, and genre attributes.
Create a base html file that uses hierarchy to pull in it's header and footer. Additionally create an index and about page that will use the base file. Present your database data on the index page.

<strong>DO NOT</strong> use other students as help until they are finshed with their classwork. Use instructions provided by the tutorial (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/tutorial01/) as a starting point.
